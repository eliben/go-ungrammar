# go-ungrammar

Ungrammar implementation and API in Go. Ungrammar is a "schema" for
[concrete syntax trees (CST)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parse_tree). For some
background on CSTs and how they relate to ASTs,
see [this blog post](https://eli.thegreenplace.net/2009/02/16/abstract-vs-concrete-syntax-trees/).

This implementation is based on the original
[ungrammar crate](https://github.com/rust-analyzer/ungrammar/), also borrowing
some test files from it.
